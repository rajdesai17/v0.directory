## Vercel Community Forum Blog Post

### Title
```
Introducing v0.directory - A Community Prompt Library for v0
```

### Post Content
```
Hey Vercel Community!

I'm excited to share a project I've been working on as a v0 Ambassador: **v0.directory** - a community-driven prompt library for v0.

## The Problem

If you've used v0, you know that the quality of your output depends heavily on the quality of your prompt. A detailed, well-structured prompt gets you production-ready code. A vague prompt gets you... something that needs a lot of iteration.

Writing great prompts takes time and practice. I wanted to make it easier for everyone to get amazing results from v0.

## The Solution

v0.directory is a curated collection of:

- **30+ Prompts** across 8 categories (dashboards, landing pages, e-commerce, animations, and more)
- **MCP Directory** with setup guides for Context7, Supabase, Stripe, and others
- **Custom Instructions** optimized for v0

Every prompt follows v0 best practices with clear sections, specific requirements, and detailed specifications.

## How It Works

1. Browse or search for a prompt
2. Click to view the full prompt
3. Copy with one click
4. Paste into v0 and watch the magic happen

## Built With v0

The entire site was built using v0 itself, showcasing what's possible:

- Next.js 15 with App Router
- Tailwind CSS v4
- shadcn/ui components
- Framer Motion animations
- TypeScript throughout

## Community Contributions

This is meant to be a community resource. You can:

- Submit prompts, MCPs, or instructions via the site
- Contributions are reviewed and credited
- Fork the project and self-host

## Links

- **Live Site:** [LINK_PLACEHOLDER]
- **GitHub:** [GITHUB_LINK_PLACEHOLDER]
- **Submit a Prompt:** [LINK_PLACEHOLDER]/submit

## What's Next

I'm planning to add:
- More prompt categories
- User accounts and favorites
- Prompt versioning
- Community voting

Would love to hear your feedback and see your prompt submissions!

### First Comment (Maker)
```
Hey Product Hunt!

I'm Raj, a v0 Ambassador, and I built v0.directory to solve a problem I kept running into: writing detailed prompts for v0 is time-consuming.

After months of experimenting, I collected my best prompts and built this directory so everyone can benefit.

The entire site was built using v0 itself - meta, right?

This is a community project. Submit your own prompts and get featured!

Would love your feedback 🙏
